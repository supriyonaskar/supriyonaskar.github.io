  abstract = {We report the enhancement of the structural stability of a DNA nanotube (DNT) by changing the salt concentrations for three different salt species, namely, NaCl, KCl, and MgCl2. Using fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we find that, with the gradual increment in the NaCl salt concentration, the DNT becomes compact and rigid. The significant reduction in the average root-mean-square deviation, root-mean-square fluctuation, and effective radius of the DNT with an increase in the NaCl concentration quantifies our observation. We explain how the DNT–ion interactions play a vital role in the conformational fluctuation of the DNT. To understand the salt dependence of the mechanical properties of the DNTs, we have calculated the stretch modulus (γ) and persistence length (LP) as a function of salt concentration. The calculated stretch moduli of the DNTs change from 8.3 to 13 nN, and the persistence length of the DNT varies from 6 to 10 μm when the NaCl salt concentration is varied from 0 to 1 M. Both the stretch modulus and the persistence length calculations reaffirm the structural stability of the DNT at higher salt concentrations. We find similar trends for another monovalent salt (KCl). However, for a divalent salt (MgCl2), we find minimal variation in the structural properties with an increase in the salt concentration.}

  abstract={We present a computational framework to model RNA based nanostructures and study their microscopic structures. We model hexagonal nanotubes made of 6 dsRNA (RNTs) connected by double crossover (DX) at different positions. Using several hundred nano-second (ns) long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we study the atomic structure, conformational change and elastic properties of RNTs in the presence of explicit water and ions. Based on several structural quantities such as root mean square deviation (RMSD) and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), we find that the RNTs are almost as stable as DNA nanotubes (DNTs). Although the central portion of the RNTs maintain its cylindrical shape, both the terminal regions open up to give rise to a gating like behavior which can play a crucial role in drug delivery. From the bending angle distribution, we observe that the RNTs are more flexible than DNTs. The calculated persistence length of the RNTs is in the micron range which is an order of magnitude higher than that of a single dsRNA. The stretch modulus of the RNTs from the contour length distribution is in the range of 4–7 nN depending on the sequence. The calculated persistence length and stretch modulus are in the same range of values as in the case of DNTs. To understand the structural properties of RNTs at the individual base-pair level we have also calculated all the helicoidal parameters and analyzed the relative flexibility and rigidity of RNTs having a different sequence. These findings emphasized the fascinating properties of RNTs which will expedite further theoretical and experimental studies in this field.}
