Hello, welcome to my homepage!

I strive to understand the physical principles that govern the microscopic world around and within me. My research primarily focuses on studying the statistical properties of nano-materials and understanding the physics behind the spatial and temporal organization of biomolecules in cells. To achieve this, I employ an integrative approach combining multiscale molecular simulations, data-driven machine learning techniques and theory from equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.

For more details about my research, please visit my [research interest](https://supriyonaskar.github.io/publications/){:target="_blank"} or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7qyxfhAAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"} page.

I am currently a Postdoctoral research fellow at [Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/home){:target="_blank"} where I am working with [Dr. Oleksandra Kukharenko](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/kremer/groups/kukharenko){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Kurt Kremer](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/kremer/director){:target="_blank"}. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral research fellow at [ICGM, University of Montpellier, CNRS, ENSCM, Montpellier, France](https://www.icgm.fr/en/){:target="_blank"} where I worked with [Prof. Guillaume Maurin](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=QNfwyjgAAAAJ&hl=fr){:target="_blank"}. I did my Ph.D. from the [Department of Physics](http://www.physics.iisc.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} of [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} under the supervision  of [Prof. Prabal K. Maiti](http://www.physics.iisc.ac.in/~maiti/){:target="_blank"}. Prior to my Ph.D., I received an M.Sc. in Physics from [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} during which I worked with [Dr. Mithun Mitra](https://sites.google.com/view/thbioiitb/home){:target="_blank"}. I received my B.Sc. degree in Physics from [Presidency University Kolkata](https://www.presiuniv.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}.
